How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
38 lines, 10px between each line. 

What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
"x = 10" means that the line we create is start at 10. "x < width-10" means that the line end at 390. "x = x + 10" means the line shows up ever 10px from 10 to 390.
